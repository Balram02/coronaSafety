Let's fight this pandemic by Spreading Awareness.

## One rule of this community:
We don't care if you break things. This is a playground and we encourage failing often. Use this as a practice ground and enjoy contributing to projects with other contributers. You will gain real world experience "working in teams" by working on these projects.


**2**. Make your first Pull Request check this free how-to tutorial at http://makeapullrequest.com/), by adding your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file in the project.
 
## Anatomy of an open source project:
Every open source community is different.

Spending years on one open source project means you’ve gotten to know _one_ open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.

That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

**Author**: The person/s or organization that created the project.

**Owner**: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author).

**Maintainers**: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (may also be authors or owners of the project).

**Contributors**: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.

**Community Members**: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.

Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.
